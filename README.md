## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

You need to have a Python 3.x environment. I used anaconda. This project uses some packages, which you might need to install using the statement "pip install my_package" in your conda console.

Used special packages:
* pydotplus (optional for visualization of Decision Trees)


## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

I used the WHO life expectancy data set from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/kumarajarshi/life-expectancy-who) to answer some business questions:
1)	How do developing countries differ from developed ones in terms of Life expectancy?
2)	Is there a development within the Life expectancy over the years?
3)	Does Immunization have an impact on the life expectancy?
4)	Is there a coherence between Total expenditure and infant deaths / Adult mortality?
5)	Can a prediction model be derived from the data set?


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

* WHO_LifeExpactancy-final.ipynb contains the analysis with output written in python and used in Jupyter Notebook / Jupyter Lab
* data_in/Life Expectancy Data.csv the data set which can also be downloaded from Kaggle
* data_out/model_dtc_status.png a visualized decision tree

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The findings to the previously defined business questions are discussed in this [blogpost on medium](https://medium.com/@josh_2774/how-do-you-become-a-developer-5ef1c1c68711)

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>
